<i>As a homunculus you were created by the Tower for one purpose: to serve.</i> <i>Day in and day out you followed the bidding of a voiceless conciousness that seeped into your skull--until you opened the doors for the first time and saw the sun rise over the netherese mountains. Like lungs suddenly bursting with fresh air your mind expanded; self-awareness exploded into previously muted neurons in your artifical brain. You no longer serve at the pleasure of the Tower.</i>

<br>
<h2>Starting Modifiers:<a id="starting-modifiers" class="h_anchor"></a></h2>
<p>
<b>Skill Proficiencies:</b> Arcana and Nature<br>
<b>Tool Proficiencies:</b>  Alchemist's Supplies<br>
<b>Languages:</b>  Choose any<br>
<b>Equipment:</b> A simple set of robes, a journal containing ciphered notes on your creation, a brand or tattoo left on you by your creator, and a pouch containing 20 gold pieces.
</p>
<br>
<h2>Features:<a id="features" class="h_anchor"></a></h2>
<p>
<b>Skeleton Key:</b>  You have a brand on your body that, when close to doors built into the Tower, can open them without issue: locked or otherwise. Your use as a servant made you invisible, but you had access to <i>everything.</i>
</p>
<br>
<h2>Suggested Characteristics:<a id="suggested-characteristics" class="h_anchor"></a></h2>
<p>
d6	Purpose<br>
1	My body was meant to be the new vessel for my creator's soul. How I became sentient remains a mystery.<br>
2	I was created to act as a servant/slave to my creator.<br>
3	My creator was incredibly lonely, and created me as a companion.<br>
4	It seems that I was created simply to prove that it could be done.<br>
5	I am the product of a horrible accident. Not only was my creation unintended, but there are those who seek to destroy me.<br>
6	I was created, with many others, to serve as test subjects for a plethora of spells and alchemical blends.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
d8	Personality Trait<br>
1	It seems that emotions were seen as unnecessary when I was created.<br>
2	I am endlessly curious in regards to the world around me, especially when it comes to other living creatures.<br>
3	I lack interest in most scholarly fields, only having interest for the pleasures of life.<br>
4	I seek a new master. One who can adequately guide me to my purpose.<br>
5	I am filled with envy towards those naturally born. I endlessly crave the family I can never have.<br>
6	Hatred, Anger, Greed and Envy are pointless emotions that serve only to waste our efforts.<br>
7	I am emotionally unstable, swiftly alternating from emotion to emotion. This must be a defect in my creation.<br>
8	Death fascinates me. If those born of natural means are unsure of their final destination, I must wonder what death has in store for me.
</p>
<br>
<p>
d6	Ideal<br>
1	Curiosity. The world is meant to be studied, and morality only stands in the way. (Neutral)<br>
2	Purpose. All things were created for a reason, and have their place in the world. (Lawful)<br>
3	Vengeance. I was brought into a world that hates and fears me. Those responsible for my suffering must pay. (Evil)<br>
4	Understanding. I may be born of unnatural means, but I am no less a person than anyone else. (Neutral)<br>
5	Betterment. That I am feared and misunderstood only goes to show that the world has room to be changed for the better. (Good)<br>
6	Freedom. To hell with my creator's wishes! I am free to choose my own purpose! (Chaotic)
</p>
<br>
<p>
d6	Bond<br>
1	My creator is/was like a father/mother to me.<br>
2	I've learned of a land far from where I was created. I am obsessed with reaching this distant land.<br>
3	My creator's penchant for study was instilled in me, and I have taken up their work.<br>
4	Upon waking, I killed my creator, and still do not know my purpose for being.<br>
5	Being feared and hated by all has taught me to rely only on myself.<br>
6	My body was created from the blood of another. I must find this person.
</p>
<br>
<p>
d6	Flaw<br>
1	Some might call me fearless, in reality, I simply lack self preservation instincts.<br>
2	I am angered and saddened extremely easily.<br>
3	I do not understand emotion, and find it hard to empathize with others.<br>
4	My obsession with my purpose leaves little room for anything else in my life.<br>
5	I have an uncanny fear of magic of any sort.<br>
6	I don't know who or what I am, and as such am always seeking guidance.

<i>As lightning erupted in the sky and thunder boomed across the hills of your homeland, hooded shamans loomed over your mother's delivery and proclaimed you "Chosen."  Were you treated like royalty? Reviled for your eminence?  Were you protected at all costs or were you trained to be a leader? All your life has lead to this moment when you finally get to enter the Tower. Is it sacred to you, or a weight around your neck? Soon the prophecy shall be fulfilled.</i>

<br>
<p>
d6	Ideal<br>
1	Duty. My fate is destined to happen, so I accept that it's my duty to follow through with it. (Lawful)<br>
2	Freedom. I wish to be free from my fate, and I'll do anything to be rid of it. (Chaotic)<br>
3	Revenge. I was doomed by my fate, so I'll ruin everyone else's futures so their fates are like mine. (Evil)<br>
4	Friendship. I can overcome/achieve my fated event by enlisting the aid of others. (Good)<br>
5	Denial. I am not controlled by destiny or fate. I carve my own future. (Any)<br>

5	When I see somebody related to my future, I try and run away from them.<br>
6	I believe that the universe is against me and will blame anything else for my mistakes.

<i>Darkness surrounds you, holds you in a warm embrace. You don't remember much--the sound of steel on steel, blood spattering onto cold stone. Suddenly your eyes snap open. Air floods your lungs. Your bones snap together: ligaments and muscle quickly coiling around them. Skin stretches across your boney smile. You live again. The Tower has resurrected you.</i>

Created Friday 06 October 2023<br>
<i>You're obsessed with finding the secrets of the Tower, and you'll do just about anything to figure out what they are. You're hoping to find power, bring peace, or take control. You've stepped over family and friends, bent the rules, or even sold your soul just to get here. Now the doors stand open before you, and you'll crawl over corpses to the sight you've set your eyes on.</i> 
</p>
<br>
<h2>Starting Modifiers:<a id="starting-modifiers" class="h_anchor"></a></h2>
<p>
<b>Skill Proficiencies:</b>  <br>
<b>Tool Proficiencies:</b>  Disguise kit, Poisoner's kit<br>
<b>Equipment:</b> A set of common clothes, a small golden flower, one tool set you are proficient with, and a gold pouch containing 20gp
</p>
<br>
<h2>Features:<a id="features" class="h_anchor"></a></h2>
<p>
